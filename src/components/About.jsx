        I'm a cyber security student at the University of HTU, currently engaged
        in offensive security and I'm interested in penetration testing, malware
        analysis, malware development and reverse engineering.<br></br>
        <br></br>I also made a few projects including this portfolio in the
        field of web development using django, react, nodejs, threejs and hosted
        them using ci/cd azure cloud services.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        By understanding the concepts of low-level languages such as memory
        handling, process injection and system calls, I am able to write more
        efficient and effective code, allowing me to develop advanced attacks
        that can penetrate even the most sophisticated defenses.<br></br>
        <br></br> Collaboration and communication with other security firms are
        crucial in this field. By working closely with other experts, we can
        develop strategic approaches to offensive cybersecurity that can drive
        strong defenses and ensure the safety of our clients digital
        infrastructure.
